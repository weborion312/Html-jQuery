			<p class="marTop2  wow fadeInUp">Osetra bay was conceived, designed and built for dining pleasure. Osetra bay was conceived, designed and built for dining pleasure. Local entrepreneur Michael Alberga and his partner Heidi Teeling joined forces with James Sedgley, a 15 year veteran of restaurant directorship in London, to set a new standard for relaxed, romantic dining that extends the warmest welcome to couples, groups and families alike. The ultimate goal was to create a unique experience in the Cayman Islands, one of the world's most exclusive destinations.
<br>
They enlisted the help of Cayman's premier builder and designer, John Hurlstone, to create a stunningly stylish venue that embodied the rustic elegance of St. Tropez and the relaxed ambience of South Beach. Employing a group of globally diverse and talented Chefs who shared their vision and had a passion for creating exceptional cuisine, Osetra Bay quickly rose to the top of the list of Cayman's must-do restaurants.
<br>
With the focus on providing exciting world cuisine enhanced by the freshest local Caribbean ingredients, Osetra Bay is now established as one of Cayman's most popular night spots.

			<p class="marTop2  wow fadeInUp">Daniel hails from Austria and as he is keen to point out, so are some of the World’s greatest Chefs – such as Wolfgang Puck and Eckart Witzigmann who was one of the first chefs outside of France to be awarded the coveted 3 Michelin stars. Daniel describes his food as earthy. He doesn’t like to mess with what he has and rather allows 3 or four flavor combinations to speak for themselves, rather than preparing what he calls fussy, over-inventive food. He has been absolutely amazed and excited, since he first arrived in Cayman, with the plethora of local seafood that is available.<br> And has worked very hard with local fisherman to develop lasting relationships to ensure he always has the pick of the freshest catch. Be it Red, black or yellow snapper, tuna or wahoo, conch or lobster. From there he says its simply a no-brainer to root yourself in Caribbean seasonings but expanded outward with more global twists on the preparations. Nor to forget the diverse talents you have in your team at your disposal. Highly experienced with over 14 years in professional kitchens, he cut his bones in some of Austria’s top Hotels including achieving the position of Sous Chef at the award winning Restaurant M32 in Salzburg as well as Executive Chef at critically acclaimed ultra modern alpine Hotel Riml, frequented by Moguls and celebrities alike.<br> Outside of Austria Daniel spread his culinary wings as Chef at Five Diamond hotel The Westgate in San Francisco USA; an experience he describes as invaluable and one that taught him that there’s a world of culturally diverse and exciting people out there waiting and desperate to try equally exciting and innovative cuisine. He didn’t disappoint. Daniel doesn’t mess around with fancy techniques. He just wants the best from his food. If you ask him what’s his favorite piece of equipment is he’ll tell you, “My Chef’s Knife – If you don’t have a decent one, just leave the kitchen and forget it because you haven’t got your priorities right. I also keep it close by for when people ask me about either Lederhosen or Yodeling!” He’s a bit of a joker too. Come and meet Daniel at Osetra Bay and enjoy your evening with us
